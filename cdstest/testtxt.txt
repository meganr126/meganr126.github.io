Dear Cornell Community 

One of the main reasons I came to Cornell was my admiration for its founding principle to be a university for  any person     The events of the last few weeks are thus deeply painful  and  of course  the pain is magnified a thousandfold for those whose dignity and  indeed  very bodies have been attacked 

I will not tell you  this is not who we are   as the events of the past few weeks belie that  But it is absolutely not who we want to be  The leadership team and I have been working throughout the weekend  and we will continue to do so  to develop and implement steps to be a more equitable  inclusive and welcoming university 

Today  I am writing to update you on some of those steps  This is not the last word but  rather  a starting point 

While our own investigation and that of the Ithaca Police Department (IPD) into the early Friday morning violence in Collegetown continue  as soon as those investigations are completed we will take appropriate disciplinary action against individuals and organizations involved 
Based on what we know  and pending final investigation  Cornell will not consider Psi Upsilon s reinstatement as an affiliated fraternity 
I am directing the heads of the Interfraternity and Panhellenic councils to develop a substantive and meaningful diversity training and education program for all their members  to be implemented before the spring recruitment 
Within the next two weeks  I will convene a Presidential Task Force charged with examining and addressing persistent problems of bigotry and intolerance at Cornell  The task force will identify the problems that are preventing us from being a fully welcoming and inclusive community and make specific recommendations about how our community can move forward with greater respect  understanding and inclusivity  This week I will meet with student  faculty and staff leaders to refine the task force s charge and to discuss membership 
I am charging the dean of students to create and implement an alternative dispute resolution process based on restorative justice that can be a resource  in conjunction with our disciplinary system  for students in addressing any future incidents 
We have been working to develop and/or enhance programs and services that support diversity and inclusion on our campuses  and this week Provost Kotlikoff and Vice President Lombardi will announce several new commitments in this area 
Because issues of bigotry expand beyond the boundaries of our campuses  this weekend I have also been in discussions with leaders of the greater Ithaca community about ways in which we can work across the community to address these issues  I will update you about these ongoing conversations over the coming weeks 

For the vast majority of Cornellians who abhor these recent events  our community needs your help  Please speak out against injustice  racism and bigotry  and reach out to support one another  Ours must be a community grounded in mutual respect and kindness 

Sincerely 

Martha E  Pollack
President
